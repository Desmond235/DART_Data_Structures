2. Selection Sort
Steps:

Start with the first element as the minimum.
Compare the minimum element with all other elements in the list.
Once the smallest element is found, swap it with the first unsorted element.
Move the boundary of the sorted part to the right and repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the list.
Repeat until the list is fully sorted.
