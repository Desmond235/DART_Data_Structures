1. Bubble Sort
Steps:

1. Start from the first element of the list.
2  Compare the current element with the next element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
2. Continue this process for all adjacent pairs.
5. After each full pass through the list, the largest element will "bubble" to the end.
6. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the list.
7. Stop when no swaps are made on a pass.
