 Quick Sort
Steps:

1. Select a "pivot" element from the list.
2. Partition the list into two sublists: one with elements smaller than the pivot, and one with elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to both sublists.
4. Combine the sorted sublists with the pivot to form the sorted list.
